# Student List Manager

## Introduction
The **Student List Manager** is a simple Java console application that organizes and manages a list of students using a tree data structure. The root node represents the entire student body, with child nodes for years, sections, and individual students.

## Features
1. Add students under a specific year and section.
2. View all students in a hierarchical structure.
3. Exit the program.

## Why This Application Was Created
This application was created to demonstrate the practical application of tree data structures. It organizes student information systematically, making it easier to access and manage data. The project serves as a learning tool for understanding the basics of tree structures and their real-world use.

## How It Contributes
- **To Me (the Developer):** This project has helped me improve my programming and problem-solving skills by applying tree structures in Java.
- **To the Community:** Can be adapted by schools or organizations to manage student or member lists effectively.

## How It Works
1. **Add Student:** Enter the year, section, and student name. The program creates nodes for each hierarchy level if they donâ€™t already exist.
2. **View Students:** Displays all students in a structured format.
3. **Exit:** Ends the program.
